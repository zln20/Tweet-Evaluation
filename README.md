This is a task related to NLP where I have used a dataset containing tweets and emotions. This is a text classification model in which I have used HuggingFace library to train the bert model. Firstly, I have preprocessed the dataset using AutoTokenizer function which converts unstructured text data into numerical array basd on mapping. Then, I have created train dataset for training our model and validation dataset for checking the accuracy of our model. After preprocessing, I have imported all the important libraries and have compiled the model using Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical crossentropy for the loss function and sparse categorical accuracy for the metric. The final step of the model is training on the train dataset and checking the accuracy on the validation dataset. Our model is complete and we achieve 79% accuracy. We can further improve the accuracy by finetuning the hyperparameters or processing the dataset more.
